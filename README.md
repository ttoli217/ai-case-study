## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? May Mobility is dedicated to crafting the pinnacle of autonomy systems with its exclusive Multi-Policy Decision Making (MPDM) system. This proprietary technology surpasses traditional rules-based systems by adeptly navigating distinctive challenges, ensuring heightened reliability, and facilitating rapid scalability.


* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? Government, college campuses. airports. healthcare, corporate campuses and planned communities. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) 
May Mobility's MPDM system revolutionizes the approach to autonomous vehicles (AVs). Instead of dictating specific actions like traditional rules-based systems, MPDM employs real-time, on-board simulations to envision myriad scenarios constantly. This empowers vehicles to autonomously discern the safest course of action. The continuous simulations foster emergent behavior, enabling vehicles to tackle any conceivable challenge swiftly and effectively.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? LIDARs and more powerful GPUs 


## Landscape

* What field is the company in? Automonous software

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years? 
The future of autonomous vehicles is poised to witness a plethora of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) aimed at enhancing driving safety for motorists. These electronic systems evolve through continuous ADAS development, drawing insights from various data sources such as radar, LiDAR, image sensors, and computer vision technologies. AI in automotive applications harnesses deep learning technology to iteratively enhance its performance, enabling it to make refined decisions based on accumulated experience. This evolution leads to safer, smoother, smarter, and more efficient rides. Whether it acts as a supportive aid to human drivers or assumes complete control, AI stands as a pivotal element in advancing autonomous vehicles. It serves as a major catalyst for the development of level-4 and level-5 autonomous systems. Anticipated advancements in safe and seamless all-weather autonomous driving are expected to drive significant market growth in the sector.

* What are the other major companies in this field?  May Mobility does not focus on taxir services or personal vechicles so that really limits its competitiors but as far as software comparison Waymo, Cruz, Tesla and Cruise are all major competitiors.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? MPDM's proven track record has delivered more than 350,000 autonomy-enabled rides to date in several public transit applications across the U.S. and Japan.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics? Success is measureed in government contracts via market deployments, B2B contracts and often total rides in market areas. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field? May Mobility recognized on Fast Company’s 2024 list of the Most Innovative Companies
  
## Recommendations
