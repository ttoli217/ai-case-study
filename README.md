## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve? May Mobility is dedicated to crafting the pinnacle of autonomy systems with its exclusive Multi-Policy Decision Making (MPDM) system. This proprietary technology surpasses traditional rules-based systems by adeptly navigating distinctive challenges, ensuring heightened reliability, and facilitating rapid scalability.


* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? Government, college campuses. airports. healthcare, corporate campuses and planned communities. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) 
May Mobility's MPDM system revolutionizes the approach to autonomous vehicles (AVs). Instead of dictating specific actions like traditional rules-based systems, MPDM employs real-time, on-board simulations to envision myriad scenarios constantly. This empowers vehicles to autonomously discern the safest course of action. The continuous simulations foster emergent behavior, enabling vehicles to tackle any conceivable challenge swiftly and effectively.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? LIDARs and more powerful GPUs 


## Landscape
